# Recommender-System-Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation of the-state-of-art recommender system algorithms on multi-behavior datasets including Beibei, Taobao, and Rocket. To experiment, I use the evaluation code of [Graph Heterogeneous Multi-Relational Recommendation](https://chenchongthu.github.io/files/AAAI_GHCF.pdf) to compare fairly.
